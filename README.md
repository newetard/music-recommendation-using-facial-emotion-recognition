# music-recommendation-using-facial-emotion-recognition
This project recommends music on the basis of your facial expressions. made using [FER2013 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013) and Spotify API, it can detect 7 emotions.
The project works by getting a live video feed from webcam and then passing it through the model to get a prediction of emotion. it classifies playlists into genres, playing a song that suits the mood specified by facial analysis.
